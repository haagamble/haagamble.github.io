# Hi, I’m Heather

I'm a lifelong learner and project enthusiast. I started this blog to document the many projects I take on, from coding experiments and web design to knitting patterns and digital crafting adventures. I believe that every project — finished or still gathering dust — helps me move forward on the journey of learning. Whether I'm exploring a new tech tool or trying a new craft, I love sharing what I discover along the way.

You never know what you’ll find here — a bit of code, a ball of yarn, or a digital experiment involving AI, music, or pixel magic. I like to think of this blog as my digital junk drawer: full of interesting things, a little messy, but always worth digging through.
