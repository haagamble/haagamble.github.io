# Hello. I'm Heather.
I’ve been building and maintaining websites for over a decade, starting with a simple HTML and CSS site and gradually expanding my skills as my projects evolved. My first website, Talk Tajik Today, began as a static website, later moved to WordPress to support features like a word-of-the-day email, and is now a static site hosted on GitHub. Each transition reflected a practical need and an opportunity to learn new tools and workflows.

I’m especially interested in language learning, educational resources, and using technology to support learning. Over the years, I’ve worked with JavaScript, Python, React, Vue, static site generators, and GitHub-based workflows. Some projects were built from scratch, while others began as existing codebases. One project I particularly enjoyed was transforming a Wordle-style game into a Tajik version. More recently, I’ve used AI pair coding tools to speed up development and explore more ideas.

This portfolio reflects how I learn: by building, revisiting, and improving real projects. I often take on projects simply to learn a tool or concept, and I treat the finished result as part of that learning process. I enjoy steady, hands-on problem-solving and revisiting projects over time as my understanding grows. 

The projects here reflect my ongoing interest in language learning and building tools that support how people learn. I’m open to collaboration, feedback, and opportunities where curiosity, persistence, and thoughtful learning are valued.
